# IOT based Water Monitoring System 

We have designed an advanced monitoring system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, equipped with various sensors. These sensors,  including flow sensors, are strategically placed to monitor usage and flow status in the pipeline comprehensively. The central control hub of this system is the NodeMCU, a general-purpose microcontroller that seamlessly coordinates the entire hardware configuration.

 NodeMCU's integrated Wi-Fi module  plays a central role in supporting real-time data transmission. Data collected by the sensors is easily transmitted to Firebase, a cloud-based platform, where the data is securely stored and  accessible for further analysis and use. The biggest highlight of this innovative system is its integration with a user-friendly mobile application. The app serves as a visual interface for the end user, visualizing water consumption, flow statistics, and even water purity information. Through this comprehensive monitoring system, users gain valuable information about their water consumption and the status of their water resources, promoting responsible and informed water management.
